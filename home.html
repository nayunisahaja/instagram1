			<p>According to screenshots shared by TestingCatalog, Instagram is adding labels that say “Reshared Post” for those posts that are shared from the feed. This applies to photos, videos, and even Reels. Instagram already has an option for users to share Reels as Stories or to their feed.

This feature is however, in testing and hasn’t been officially announced yet. <br>

During this test, you won’t be able to add a feed post to your story.</p>
